üîç Facing unsymbolicated stack traces but don't have the load address for the atos command to manually symbolicate them?

At runtime, provides an array of strings representing binary image infos that give you that information.

Use case could be you have partially symbolicated crash reports and have access to the remotely generated output of this utility.  
The build that runs it must match the build of the stack frame you want to symbolicate.

e.g.:
```
atos -arch arm64 -o [YOUR-DSYM-ID].dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/[YOUR APP] -l 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000
```

### Usage:

```
BinaryImagesInspector.getBinaryImagesInfo()
```

Example:
```
import BinaryImagesInspector
import os.log

let binInfos = BinaryImagesInspector.getBinaryImagesInfo()
let logStr = binInfos.joined(separator: "\n")
os_log("%{public}@", logStr)
```

### Output:
Example on iOS:
```
YourApp 0x00000001adb1e000 - arm64e - E9B05479-3D07-390C-BD36-73EEDB2B1F75
CoreGraphics 0x00000001a92dd000 - arm64e - 2F7F6EE8-635C-332A-BAC3-EFDA4894C7E2
CoreImage 0x00000001afc00000 - arm64e - CF56BCB1-9EE3-392D-8922-C8894C9F94C7
